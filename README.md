# VKCrypto Library

This library was originally created to handle virtual keys in a database and in a python client in a paranoid way; it's designed to be simple, as it only contains three algorithms:

  - Scrypt Hashing
  - Encryption with AES 256 CBC and a Scrypt hash
  - RSA Encryption with AES 256 CBC

# Dependencies

In order to compile you must have OpenSSL, [libscrypt](https://github.com/technion/libscrypt) installed as development packages.

#Usage

Coming soon...
